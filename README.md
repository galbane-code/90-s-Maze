# ATP-2020
This project combines maze creation and search algorithms.
For creating the maze, we used Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree.
For solving the maze, we used BFS, DFS and UCS algorithms.
In addition, we used client-server architecture in order to request (client) a maze solve\creation (server) operators combining compression thechnique for
efficient communication and data transfer.
The MazeFX repository is for the actual maze game visuzlization using javaFX.
